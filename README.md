# archiver
Archives video clips from Final Cut Pro X Libraries into a generic file-based structure with a JSON database per Event

I wrote this to archive all of the video that was being held in FCPX so that I could access clips in years to come.

Requires that your system has the 'mediainfo' and 'ffmpeg' commands available.  Only tested on OSX (obviously).
